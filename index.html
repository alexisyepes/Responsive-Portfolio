                    My name is Alexis Yepes Sanabria. I was born in Colombia, a beautiful country that is located in 
                    South America. I grew up in a time when technology was only seen in Hollywood movies or read in sci-fi books. 
                    Nowadays, our lives have been taken over by a single-portable-machine: The Smartphone.

                    I began teaching myself how to play the guitar when I was 6 years old. However, a year later I began 
                    taking guitar lessons until high school. After graduating from high school, I decided to enroll in a music
                    program. However, the computer world was also catching my attention. So after some discussion with my 
                    parents, I made the decision to enroll in a computer programming program back in 2002. 
                    I was enjoying learning about computers (and playing in a Rock Band), when the political climate of 
                    my country forced me to leave. Unfortunately, there was a war going on between the rebels and the 
                    government, where young people were being recruited against their will. As a result, my parents made 
                    me flee Colombia and I ended up living in the USA- the country where I met the person I was going to be 
                    sharing my life with. After a couple of years in the US, we came to Canada, the most beautiful country 
                    in the world. I instantly fell in love with its people, its weather (believe it or not, Winter is my 
                    favourite season), and most of all, its respect for the human being. Many years have passed, I got married, 
                    had children, and now...I'm back in the Computer World. Hell yeah!!!
